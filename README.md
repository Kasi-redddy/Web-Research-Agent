# Web-Research-Agent
This project provides a research agent that fetches top search results from the web using DuckDuckGo, scrapes content from the fetched pages, analyzes the content for relevance to the search query, and generates a research report based on the results.

#Features
Web Search: Perform a web search using DuckDuckGo.

Web Scraping: Scrape the top results from the search and extract text.

Content Analysis: Analyze the relevance of the content based on the search query using SequenceMatcher.

Report Generation: Generate a research report with URLs, relevance scores, and summaries of the content.

#Requirements
Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your machine. You can install the required dependencies by running:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt

#Here is a list of the dependencies:

requests: To send HTTP requests and retrieve webpage data.

beautifulsoup4: To parse and extract HTML content from web pages.

duckduckgo_search: To perform web searches using DuckDuckGoâ€™s API.

#Setup
Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.

#Install dependencies:

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt


#Usage
Run the app.py file:

bash

python app.py

You will be prompted to enter a research query (e.g., "apple" or "latest technology trends").

The program will perform a search, scrape the top results, analyze their relevance, and generate a research report.

The report will display the URLs of the top results, their relevance scores, and a short summary of each page's content.

#Example
If you enter the query apple, the program will fetch the top 5 search results, scrape the pages, and display a research report with the relevant information.

Code Structure
